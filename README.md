# Pokémon Quiz (MVP scaffold)

This is the MVP scaffold for the Pokémon Quiz web app (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS).

- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Start: `npm start`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`

Notes
- Remote images are allowed for official artwork from raw.githubusercontent.com (see `next.config.ts`).
- Global dark theme is enabled; Tailwind is configured with class strategy (`dark`).
- The game logic, typeahead, and data index come next (Phase 2+ per ROADMAP).

See `ROADMAP.md` for the phased implementation plan.
