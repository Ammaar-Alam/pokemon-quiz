# Pokémon Quiz (Made in like an hour)

This is the MVP scaffold for the Pokémon Quiz web app (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS).

- Dev: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Start: `npm start`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
- Build index (first run): `npm run build:index`

Notes
- Started playing some old Pokemon games and thought it would be fun to try seeing how many pokemon I could name, other quizes like this exist but I didn't like the way they were implemented; most wouldn't show a picture (I am not remembering 1025 pokemon off the top of my head stfu) or were just complicated idk, so i decided to really quickly make my own
- This is literally just a intrusive thought that I decided to create for fun; lots of AI was used, the code could be cleaner, etc.
- Instead of deploying via heroku (why on earth would i pay to host this) or using the normal GitHub Pages (which wouldn't support the pokemon index import), @ my last internship i got a lot of experience with devops and CI/CD, so i thought it would be fun to make the deployment a GHA workflow hehe
